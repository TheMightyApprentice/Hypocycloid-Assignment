# HypocycloidAssignment
Program that creates a hypocycloid using HTML, Javascript, and WebGL.

A definition for hypocycloid can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypocycloid

-Common folder holds three pre-made files not made by me but required to run the main .html and .prog files.

-A represents the radius of the bigger circle while B represents the radius of the smaller circle.

-When refreshing the page or reseting the drawing, the hypocycloid image will revert to how it would look as if A = 5 and B = 1. 

-The user values from when a person last entered them in will stay and must be replaced with a different number in order to create more drawings.

-Shapes formed from A < B can be created but will be cut.

-Shapes that require 250 revolutions or less around the circle will now appear (before it was shapes that only required 2).

-Animations can be done with the completed shape with these buttons:

  w: Spins the shape and then stops in the default orientation the shape was in origionally.
  
  Shift + w: Continuously spins the shape until Shift + w is pressed again.
  
  b: Makes the shape "boing" outward and return to its original shape.
  
  Shift + b: Continuously "boings" the shape in and out until Shift + b is pressed again. 

***Make sure to extract files before running the HTML.
