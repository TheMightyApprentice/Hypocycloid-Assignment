# HypocycloidAssignment
Program that creates a hypocycloid using HTML, Javascript, and WebGL.

A definition for hypocycloid can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypocycloid

-Common folder holds three pre-made files not made by me but required to run the main .html and .prog files.

-A represents the radius of the bigger circle while B represents the radius of the smaller circle.

-When refreshing the page or reseting the drawing, the hypocycloid image will revert to how it would look as if A = 5 and B = 1. 

-The user values from when a person last entered them in will stay and must be replaced with a different number in order to create more drawings.
